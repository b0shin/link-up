# Link Up

**Link Up** is a ZIP-code-driven resource hub for community support. Users enter a 5-digit ZIP code and are guided to categories like:

- 🛌 Shelter Up — housing, shelters, and transitional living
- 🥪 Eat Up — food pantries and meals
- 👕 Suit Up — clothing banks
- 💊 Heal Up — health clinics and services
- 📚 Skill Up — job training and education
- 🚿 Clean Up — hygiene stations and facilities

## How It Works

1. User lands on `index.html` and enters a ZIP code
2. Tiles appear with clickable categories
3. Each tile routes to its own results page (e.g. `shelter-up.html`)
4. Results are filtered using live data from Google Sheets
